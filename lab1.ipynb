        "The orientation of a Dual Inline Package (DIP) chip is unambiguously indicated by a notch at one end of the chip. The numbering of the pins is based on the location of that _index_ marker. Consider the diagram on page 2 of the [74HC02 datasheet](../../refs/datasheet/74hc02.pdf). When the index notch is on the left, pin 1 is just below it. Pins are numbered counter-clockwise from pin 1. The highest numbered pin on an DIP chip is always at the upper right when the index notch is on the left. This is the conventional orientation for a DIP chip, and we will use this format in photographs for the labs. Nevertheless, you should be able to identify pin numbers on a chip if it is upside down or in any other arbitrary orientation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The orientation **every** DIP package and the location of its pin 1 is determined by this index notch. It does not matter how many pins a DIP package has. You can always find pin 1 by this method, and the pins are numbered counter-clockwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pick up some of the chips in your lab kit and feel the index notches on them. Notice that the text on each chip is readable when the index notch is to the left. Can you identify the pin numbers? You may also see one or more slight circular depressions in the top of the chip. Those are vent holes for the injection-molding process used to form the plastic package. They are meaningless for a DIP chip. Such circles may be important for other kinds of packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Integrated circuits are often available in multiple kinds of packages. Each type of package has its own accepted format for identifying its pin numbering. For instance, look at page 9 of the same datasheet for the 74HC02 you were asked to look at. This is a Small Outline 14-pin (SO14) package. The orientation of the chip and the location of pin 1 is determined by a bevel on one edge of the chip. Page 10 shows the format of a Shrink Small-Outline Package (SSOP14) implementation of the chip. Here, a circular depression indicates the orientation of the chip. Page 11 shows a similar Thin-Shrink Small-Outline Package (TSSOP14). Finally, page 12 shows the pin configuration for a Heat-Sink Very-Thin Quad Flat-Pack no-leads 14-pin (HVQFN14) package. This one does not have two rows of pins. Instead, they are arranged around all four sides of the chip. Hmm... which one is pin 1? How do you determine that?\n",
        "\n",
        "When you are reading documentation to identify the pins for a chip in this class, always make sure you are looking at the DIP package. Usually, pin configurations for things like SO, SOP, and TSSOP packages are similar."
